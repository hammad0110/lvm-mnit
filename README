During  our 24hr hackathon at MNIT Jaipur , we chose the problem statement- Develop a tool that can use AI to automatically identify and fix security vulnerabilities in software code.

The solution and approach to this problem statement is as follows :
 
1. Developing a Command Line Interface for testing the source code and using the api calls from ml model to detect security vulnerabilities in source code .
2. Using CI/CD for automation of threat(CSS , SQL injection etc) removal and vulnerabilities .
3. Creating a vs code etension that scans the input file provided from user . It will check for vulnerability in the source code and all other files of the directory.
   If any vulnerability is detected iit will try to log the error and try to detect the error using ml model.
